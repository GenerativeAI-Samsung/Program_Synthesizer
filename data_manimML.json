The layer spacing is set to 0.25.\n\nIn detail, the neural network architecture contains the following layers:\n\n1. FeedForwardLayer(num_nodes=2): The input layer has 2 nodes, which means the network can handle 2-dimensional input data.\n2. MaxPooling2DLayer(kernel_size=4): The second layer is a max pooling layer with a kernel size of 4. This means that the layer will downsample the input data by a factor of 4 in both the height and width dimensions, reducing the number of parameters and the number of computations.\n3. FeedForwardLayer(num_nodes=5): The third layer is another feedforward layer with 5 nodes. This layer will process the output from the max pooling layer and produce an output with 5 nodes.\n4. FeedForwardLayer(num_nodes=6): The fourth layer is the final feedforward layer with 6 nodes. This layer will process the output from the third layer and produce the final output of the network.\n5. The layer spacing is set to 0.25, which means that the layers are spaced at 25% of the input size.\n\nThis neural network architecture is suitable for image classification tasks, where the input data is 2D and needs to be processed hierarchically.

This layer takes in the input data and passes it through a non-linear transformation to create the first layer of features. The next layer is a MaxPooling2DLayer with a kernel size of 6, which reduces the spatial dimensions of the data while retaining the most important information. Following this is a Convolutional2DLayer with 4 feature maps, a feature map size of 8, a filter size of 9, and a filter spacing of 0.86. This layer applies a convolution operation to the data to extract local features. The fourth layer is another FeedForwardLayer with 7 nodes and uses the ReLU activation function. This layer processes the output from the convolutional layer and creates a new set of features. Finally, there is a second MaxPooling2DLayer with a kernel size of 4, which further reduces the spatial dimensions of the data. The layer spacing is set to 0.25, which controls the amount of data shared between layers. With these specific numerical values, this neural network is designed to process data with a relatively small number of features and a medium-sized filter.",

The hidden layer has 3 nodes or neurons, and the layer spacing is set to 0.25. This means that the weights and biases of the neurons in the hidden layer are initialized with a random value between 0 and 0.25, which helps to prevent the neurons from being too similar to each other and improves the generalization of the network. The activation function used in the hidden layer is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which outputs 0 for negative input values and the input value for positive input values. This helps to introduce non-linearity in the model and allows the network to learn more complex patterns in the data.",
